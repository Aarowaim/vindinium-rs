# vindinium-rs
An http://vindinium.org api written in rust.

Once you've cloned the repository, just create a file called `key.txt` and paste your unique vindinium key into the file at the root directory. The current example resides in `main.rs`, where the various modules have been put together to run training.

This crate is made so that `cargo` is the only tool required.
